**TurfSync** is a desktop-based application developed using **C# Graphical User Interface (GUI)** with SQL Server database integration. It is designed to digitize and automate the manual process of turf scheduling, booking, maintenance, and service evaluation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional turf management relies on phone calls and handwritten registers, leading to double bookings and poor tracking. **TurfSync** solves this by simulating a real-life management environment using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as encapsulation, modularity, and role-based access control.

**Key Highlights:**
* **Role-Based Access:** Secure login for Admin, Manager, Staff, and Players.
* **Real-Time Scheduling:** Dynamic status updates (Available, Booked, Maintenance).
* **Database Normalization:** Database structured up to **2NF** to ensure data integrity.
* **Feedback System:** Players can rate service quality, lighting, and turf condition.
